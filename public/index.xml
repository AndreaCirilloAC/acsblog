      <description>The greatest part of my time at working is spent looking at those great piece of statistical machinery that credit risk models are. That is why I was recently required to prepare a short course about the new definition of default, which is goign to be applied from 01/01/2021 on.
It is quite a unexplored topic in the sector and I haven‚Äôt found a lot of teaching material online, that is why I tought to share here the brief deck of slide I produced for the occasion.</description>

      <description>It has being nearly half an year since the last post about workflower was out, why did I stay so silent for that long?
I have three major updates to explain the silence:
 üìö Good guys atPackt publishing asked me to write one more book about R and data mining, I suppose this is because the first one was well received
 üì¶ I spend my spare time working on updateR so to get it ready to go on CRAN.</description>

I was doing such a list for myself ( you know that feeling &amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;how would it look like with this theme? let&amp;rsquo;s try this one&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;) and at the end I thought it could have be useful for my readers. At least this post will save you the time of trying all differents themes just to have a sense of how they look like.</description>

      <description>I am really enjoying Uefa Euro 2016 Footbal Competition, even because our national team has done pretty well so far. That&amp;rsquo;s why after browsing for a while¬†statistics section of official EURO 2016 website I decided to do some analysis on the data they share ( as at the 21th of June).
Just to be clear from the beginning: we are not talking of anything too rigourus, but just about some interesting questions with related answers gathered mainly through data visualisation.</description>

So here we are, find below an useful checklist for your weekly review. The checklist is derived directly from the official GTD book by our great friend David Allen. The greatest quality of the checklist is the minimalist approach: just what you really need to read is written within each point, so that you get through your review as quick as possible.</description>

The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This blog was viewed about **8,800** times in 2015. If it were a concert at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 3 sold-out performances for that many people to see it. Click here to see the complete report.</description>

      <description>This is not actually a real post but rather¬†a code snippet surrounded by text.
Nevertheless I think it is a quite useful one: have you ever found yourself writing a function where a data frame is created, wanting to name that data frame based on a custom argument passed to the function?
For instance, the output of your function is a really nice data frame name in a really trivial way, like &amp;ldquo;result&amp;rdquo;.</description>

In the next hours¬†things got growing by themselves, with pleasant results like the following:

That got me move my Shiny App on an Amazon AWS instance.
Well, it was not so straight forward: even if there is plenty of tutorials around the web, every one seems to miss a part: upgrading R version, removing shiny-server examples&amp;hellip; And even having all info¬†it is still quite a long, error-prone process.</description>

More than one hundred years later, we can use this curious finding¬†to look for fraud on populations of data. just give a try to the shiny app What &amp;lsquo;Benford&amp;rsquo;s Law&amp;rsquo; stands for? Around 1938 Frank Benford, a physicist at the General Electrics research laboratories, observed that logarithmic tables were more worn¬†within first pages: was this casual or due to an actual prevalence of numbers near 1 as first digits?</description>

The main purpose of the paper is to &amp;ldquo;teach&amp;rdquo; good programming habits shared from professional developers to people that weren&amp;rsquo;t born developer, and became developers just for professional purposes.
Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using software. However, most scientists are never taught how to do this efficiently Best Practices for Scientific Computing    Write programs for people, not computers.</description>

then datasets got bigger, and I discovered that¬†little spreadsheets were not¬†enough, and look for something bigger and stronger, eventually coming to R.
But as you know, ones never forget¬†the first love.
So, for fun and for practice, I have written down some of excel functions in R.

      <description>Following the post about %in% operator, I received this tweet: https://twitter.com/benwhite21/status/510520550553165824
I gave a look to the code kindly provided by Ben¬†and then I asked myself: I know dplyr is a really nice package, but which snippet is faster?
to answer the¬†question I&amp;rsquo;ve put the two snippets in two functions:
#Ben snippet dplyr_snippet =function(object,column,vector){ filter(object,object[,column] %in% vector) } #AC snippet Rbase_snippet =function(object,column,vector){ object[object[,column] %in% vector,] }
Then, thanks to the great package microbenchmark, I made a comparison between those two functions, testing the time of execution of both, for 100.</description>

      <title>Code snippet: subsetting data frame in R by vector</title>
      <link>/2014/09/02/r-subset-data-frame/</link>

      <guid>/2014/09/02/r-subset-data-frame/</guid>
      <description>Problem: you haveto subset a data frame using as criteria the exact match of a vector content.
for instance:
you have a dataset with some attributes, and you have a vector with some values of one of the attributes. You want to make a filter based on the values in the vector. Example: sales records, each record is a deal.
The vector is a list of selected customers you are interested in.</description>

      <description>I have just saturated all my PC:
full is the 4gb RAM

and so is the CPU (I7 4770 @3.4 GHZ)

Parallel Computation in R which is my secret?
the doParallel package for R on mac
The package lets you make some very useful parallel computation, giving you the¬†possibility¬†to use all the potentiality of your CPU.
As a matter of fact, the standard R option is to use just on of the cores you have got on your PC.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been recently asked to analyze some Board entertainment expenditures in order to acquire sufficient assurance about their nature and responsible.
In response to that request I have developed a¬†little Shiny app with an interesting reactive Bubble chart.
The plot, made using ggplot2 package, is composed by: a categorical x value, represented by the clusters identified in the expenditures population A numerical y value, representing the total amount expended Points defined by the total amount of expenditure in the given cluster for each company subject.</description>

 by one hand in our society tend to succeed those whose can be considered high-skilled like real professionals in data science realm on the other hand the same society force ourself to an increasingly fragmented style of life, full of shallow stimolous and activites, like reading Facebook notifications or immediately reply to emails  That is why the good author of the book calls for a regaining of the ability to perform Deep Work i.</description>

      <description>R data mining is a data mining crime book, a new kind of book we developed with good guys at Packt and the great statistician Enrico Pegoraro.

What is a data mining crime book? It is a book stucture to teach you data mining fundamentals while immersing you in a crime case.
Within R data mining you will be immersed into the life of a wholesale company, where suddenly a misterious drop in profits arises.</description>

      <description>On november 20th I was requested to make a keynote speech at the 9th MilanoR meeting, the most relevant italian meeting of R users.
The main topic of the speech was one of my last coding fatigues: the Paletter package, a new R package able to derive an optimised colour palette from any kind of image.
 You can also find a kind reportage of the evening directly on the official MilanoR blog, and the full deck of slides online.</description>
