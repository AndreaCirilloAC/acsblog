On november 20th I was requested to **make a keynote speech** at the **9th MilanoR meeting**, the most relevant **italian meeting of R users**.

The main topic of the speech was one of my last coding fatigues: **the [Paletter](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/paletter) package**, a new R package able to **derive** an optimised **colour palette** from **any** kind of **image**.

You can also find a kind reportage of the evening directly on the official [MilanoR blog](http://www.milanor.net/blog/9th-milanor-dataviz-presentations-photos/), and the full [deck of slides online](http://www.milanor.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/paletter-Cirillo-1.pdf).

I am planning to write more about paletteR and how it works,in the meanwhile you can find its whole code on the github repository: [https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/paletter](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/paletter)
