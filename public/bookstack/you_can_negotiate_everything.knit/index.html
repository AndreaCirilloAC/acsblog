    <span><h3>Herb Cohen</h3></span>
    

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>The first time you come across <em>You can negotiate everything</em> by Herb Cohen it can appears one of those books full of techniques to manipulate people and persuade them to do what you want. But if you move beyond this first impression you can find a useful book written by someone who certainly was able in the pragmatic art of getting someone to agree with you but was also persuaded that the best way to do this was to build a good relationship based on trust with the other side in every negotiation.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is a belief i profoundly share with the author and I am making also a project out of this (<a href="http://www.smoothjob.info">www.smoothjob.info</a> if you are interested in the project). It was thus a pleasure for me to find this wiew in a book written from a so greatly experienced deal-maker.
Let's move on to the actual summary of the book which I hope will help you appreaciate the valuable content included within it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-negotiation">What is negotiation?</h2>
<p>Negotiation is a field of knowledge and endeavor that focuses on gaining the favor of people from whome we want things. Three elements are always there in every negotiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information</li>
<li>Time (pressure, deadline)</li>
<li>Power</li>
</ul>
<p>Every negotiation is a satisfaction of needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you let the other side understand that your need ar enot fully satisfied, you will let him understand also that his own will not be. For instance expressing criticism on a product you are negotiating</li>
<li>if you make someone invest time in the negotiation, his cost in case of leaving will rise
<ul>
<li>he will be more willing to comply with your requests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>leverage the power of weakness
<ul>
<li>learn to ask questions more than talking</li>
<li>looking silly dismiss a lot of other side weapons</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-the-three-elements-of-a-negotitation">About the three elements of a negotitation</h2>
<h3 id="power">Power</h3>
<p>Power is a way of getting from one place to another.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is neither good nor bad by itself: it is neutral</li>
<li>it is needed to believe you are able to obtain/create/realize something rather than suffer everything</li>
<li>believing you have power will give you the necessary self confidence. This will project the rigth image of self confidence and make others more willing to comply.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sources of power</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>power of competition</p>
<ul>
<li>if you create competition around something you possess, what you have moves up in value (ideas, products, yourself, everything)</li>
<li>you can create competition if you have alternative options ( more buyers for your product, more companies willing to hire you&hellip;). Never enter a negotiation without options!</li>
<li>try to convey a sense of not needing what you are negotiating. This reminds me of this scene from <em>Gone with the wind</em>, I don't know why</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</li>
<li>
<p>power of legitimacy</p>
<ul>
<li>we tend to comply with the &ldquo;official&rdquo; printed stuff. We tend not to question them.
<ul>
<li>signs</li>
<li>books</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>this power can be used when it is advantageous and can be challenged when it is not
<ul>
<li>to challenge you have to be able to show that what is written is general and generic, and it was not mentioned to cover the specific case you are talking about.
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;that is generic, is not my case&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;where is my name on that book?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>power of risk taking</p>
</li>
</ul>
