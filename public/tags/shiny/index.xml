      <description>we all know R is the first choice for statistical analysis and data visualisation, but what about big data munging? tidyverse (or we&#39;d better say hadleyverse üòè) has been doing a lot in this field, nevertheless it is often the case this kind of activities being handled from some other coding language. Moreover, sometimes you get as an input pieces of analyses performed with other kind of languages or, what is worst, piece of databases packed in proprietary format (like .</description>

      <description>Ah, writing a blog post! This is a pleasure I was forgetting, and you can guess¬†it looking at last post date of publication: it was around january...¬†you may be wondering:¬†what have you done along this long time? Well, quite a lot indeed:
  changed my job ( I am now working @ Intesa Sanpaolo Banking Group on Basel III statistical models)
  became dad for the third time (and if you are guessing, it‚Äôs a boy!</description>

      <description>It was around midnight here in Italy: I shared the code on Github, published a post on G+,¬†Linkedin and Twitter and then went to bed.
In the next hours¬†things got growing by themselves, with pleasant results like the following:

The R community found ramazon a really helpful package.
And I actually think it is: Amazon AWS is nowadays one of the most common tools for online web applications and websites hosting.</description>

      <description>Because Afraus received a good interest, last month I override shinyapps.io free plan limits.
That got me move my Shiny App on an Amazon AWS instance.
Well, it was not so straight forward: even if there is plenty of tutorials around the web, every one seems to miss a part: upgrading R version, removing shiny-server examples&amp;hellip; And even having all info¬†it is still quite a long, error-prone process.
All this pain is removed by ramazon, an R package that I developed to take care of everything is needed to deploy a shiny app on an AWS instance.</description>

 on average, fraud accounts for nearly the 5% of companies revenues
 
Projecting this number for the whole world GDP, it results that the &amp;ldquo;fraud-country&amp;rdquo; produces something like a GDP 3 times greater than the Canadian¬†GDP.

No surprise than if companies and scholars are increasingly looking for way to prevent fraud and spot it when it occurs.</description>

      <description>As I am currently working on a Fraud Analytics Web Application¬†based on Shiny (currently on beta version, more later on this blog) I found myself asking: wouldn&#39;t be great to add live chat support to my Web Application visitors?
It would indeed!

      <description>If you have a blog¬†you may want to discover how your website is performing for given keywords on Google Search Engine. As we all know, this topic is not a trivial one.
Problem is that the analogycal solution would be quite time-consuming, requiring you to search your website for every single keyword, on many many pages.
Feeling this way?
