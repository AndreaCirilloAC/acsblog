      <description>we all know R is the first choice for statistical analysis and data visualisation, but what about big data munging? tidyverse (or we&amp;rsquo;d better say hadleyverse üòè) has been doing a lot in this field, nevertheless it is often the case this kind of activities being handled from some other coding language. Moreover, sometimes you get as an input pieces of analyses performed with other kind of languages or, what is worst, piece of databases packed in proprietary format (like .</description>

      <description>It was around midnight here in Italy: I shared the code on Github, published a post on G+,¬†Linkedin and Twitter and then went to bed.
In the next hours¬†things got growing by themselves, with pleasant results like the following:

The R community found ramazon a really helpful package.
And I actually think it is: Amazon AWS is nowadays one of the most common tools for online web applications and websites hosting.</description>

      <description>Because Afraus received a good interest, last month I override shinyapps.io free plan limits.
That got me move my Shiny App on an Amazon AWS instance.
Well, it was not so straight forward: even if there is plenty of tutorials around the web, every one seems to miss a part: upgrading R version, removing shiny-server examples&amp;hellip; And even having all info¬†it is still quite a long, error-prone process.</description>

Projecting this number for the whole world GDP, it results that the &amp;ldquo;fraud-country&amp;rdquo; produces something like a GDP 3 times greater than the Canadian¬†GDP.</description>

      <description>As I am currently working on a Fraud Analytics Web Application¬†based on Shiny (currently on beta version, more later on this blog) I found myself asking: wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be great to add live chat support to my Web Application visitors?
It would indeed!

But how to do it?
Unfortunately, looking on Google didn&amp;rsquo;t give any useful result.</description>

      <description>In the early &amp;lsquo;900 Frank Benford observed that &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; was more frequent as first digit in his own logarithms manual. More than one hundred years later, we can use this curious finding¬†to look for fraud on populations of data. just give a try to the shiny app What &amp;lsquo;Benford&amp;rsquo;s Law&amp;rsquo; stands for? Around 1938 Frank Benford, a physicist at the General Electrics research laboratories, observed that logarithmic tables were more worn¬†within first pages: was this casual or due to an actual prevalence of numbers near 1 as first digits?</description>

      <description>If you have a blog¬†you may want to discover how your website is performing for given keywords on Google Search Engine. As we all know, this topic is not a trivial one.
Problem is that the analogycal solution would be quite time-consuming, requiring you to search your website for every single keyword, on many many pages.
Feeling this way?
