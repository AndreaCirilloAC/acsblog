        <a>we all know R is the first choice for statistical analysis and data visualisation, but what about big data munging? tidyverse (or we&rsquo;d better say hadleyverse üòè) has been doing a lot in this field, nevertheless it is often the case this kind of activities being handled from some other coding language. Moreover, sometimes you get as an input pieces of analyses performed with other kind of languages or, what is worst, piece of databases packed in proprietary format (like .</a>

        <a>I am really enjoying Uefa Euro 2016 Footbal Competition, even because our national team has done pretty well so far. That&rsquo;s why after browsing for a while¬†statistics section of official EURO 2016 website I decided to do some analysis on the data they share ( as at the 21th of June).
Just to be clear from the beginning: we are not talking of anything too rigourus, but just about some interesting questions with related answers gathered mainly through data visualisation.</a>

        <a>Ah, writing a blog post! This is a pleasure I was forgetting, and you can guess¬†it looking at last post date of publication: it was around january...¬†you may be wondering:¬†what have you done along this long time? Well, quite a lot indeed:
 changed my job ( I am now working @ Intesa Sanpaolo Banking Group on Basel III statistical models)
 became dad for the third time (and if you are guessing, it‚Äôs a boy!</a>

Around 1938 Frank Benford, a physicist at the General Electrics research laboratories, observed that logarithmic tables were more worn¬†within first pages: was this casual or due to an actual prevalence of numbers near 1 as first digits?</a>

        <a>I reproduce here below principles from the amazing paper Best Practices for Scientific Computing, published on 2012 by a group of US and UK professors. The main purpose of the paper is to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; good programming habits shared from professional developers to people that weren&rsquo;t born developer, and became developers just for professional purposes.
Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using software. However, most scientists are never taught how to do this efficiently Best Practices for Scientific Computing    Write programs for people, not computers.</a>

        <a>Following the post about %in% operator, I received this tweet: https://twitter.com/benwhite21/status/510520550553165824
I gave a look to the code kindly provided by Ben¬†and then I asked myself: I know dplyr is a really nice package, but which snippet is faster?
to answer the¬†question I&rsquo;ve put the two snippets in two functions:
#Ben snippet dplyr_snippet =function(object,column,vector){ filter(object,object[,column] %in% vector) } #AC snippet Rbase_snippet =function(object,column,vector){ object[object[,column] %in% vector,] }
Then, thanks to the great package microbenchmark, I made a comparison between those two functions, testing the time of execution of both, for 100.</a>

In response to that request I have developed a¬†little Shiny app with an interesting reactive Bubble chart.
The plot, made using ggplot2 package, is composed by: a categorical x value, represented by the clusters identified in the expenditures population A numerical y value, representing the total amount expended Points defined by the total amount of expenditure in the given cluster for each company subject.</a>
