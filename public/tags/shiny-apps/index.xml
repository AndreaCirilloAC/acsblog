      <description>Ah, writing a blog post! This is a pleasure I was forgetting, and you can guess it looking at last post date of publication: it was around january... you may be wondering: what have you done along this long time? Well, quite a lot indeed:
 changed my job ( I am now working @ Intesa Sanpaolo Banking Group on Basel III statistical models)
 became dad for the third time (and if you are guessing, it’s a boy!</description>

      <description>It was around midnight here in Italy: I shared the code on Github, published a post on G+, Linkedin and Twitter and then went to bed.
In the next hours things got growing by themselves, with pleasant results like the following:

The R community found ramazon a really helpful package.
And I actually think it is: Amazon AWS is nowadays one of the most common tools for online web applications and websites hosting.</description>

      <description>Because Afraus received a good interest, last month I override shinyapps.io free plan limits.
That got me move my Shiny App on an Amazon AWS instance.
Well, it was not so straight forward: even if there is plenty of tutorials around the web, every one seems to miss a part: upgrading R version, removing shiny-server examples&amp;hellip; And even having all info it is still quite a long, error-prone process.</description>

      <description>The last Report to the Nation published by ACFE, stated that on average, fraud accounts for nearly the 5% of companies revenues.

Projecting this number for the whole world GDP, it results that the &amp;ldquo;fraud-country&amp;rdquo; produces something like a GDP 3 times greater than the Canadian GDP.</description>

      <description>As I am currently working on a Fraud Analytics Web Application based on Shiny (currently on beta version, more later on this blog) I found myself asking: wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be great to add live chat support to my Web Application visitors?
It would indeed!

But how to do it?
Unfortunately, looking on Google didn&amp;rsquo;t give any useful result.</description>

More than one hundred years later, we can use this curious finding to look for fraud on populations of data. just give a try to the shiny app What ‘Benford’s Law’ stands for? Nice stuff, but what can I do with Benford’s Law?

      <description>If you have a blog you may want to discover how your website is performing for given keywords on Google Search Engine. As we all know, this topic is not a trivial one.
Problem is that the analogycal solution would be quite time-consuming, requiring you to search your website for every single keyword, on many many pages.
Feeling this way?

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been recently asked to analyze some Board entertainment expenditures in order to acquire sufficient assurance about their nature and responsible.
In response to that request I have developed a little Shiny app with an interesting reactive Bubble chart.
The plot, made using ggplot2 package, is composed by: a categorical x value, represented by the clusters identified in the expenditures population A numerical y value, representing the total amount expended Points defined by the total amount of expenditure in the given cluster for each company subject.</description>
