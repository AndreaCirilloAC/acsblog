      <description>In the early ‘900 Frank Benford observed that ’1’ was more frequent as first digit in his own logarithms manual. More than one hundred years later, we can use this curious finding to look for fraud on populations of data. just give a try to the shiny app What ‘Benford’s Law’ stands for? Nice stuff, but what can I do with Benford’s Law? You can find fraud with it Some precautions BenfordeR: another lean shiny application performing a benford analysis plotting results detecting suspected records  What’s next   In the early ‘900 Frank Benford observed that ’1’ was more frequent as first digit in his own logarithms manual.</description>
