        <a>Ah, writing a blog post! This is a pleasure I was forgetting, and you can guess it looking at last post date of publication: it was around january... you may be wondering: what have you done along this long time? Well, quite a lot indeed:
 changed my job ( I am now working @ Intesa Sanpaolo Banking Group on Basel III statistical models)
 became dad for the third time (and if you are guessing, it’s a boy!</a>

        <a>As I am currently working on a Fraud Analytics Web Application based on Shiny (currently on beta version, more later on this blog) I found myself asking: wouldn&rsquo;t be great to add live chat support to my Web Application visitors?
It would indeed!

But how to do it?
Unfortunately, looking on Google didn&rsquo;t give any useful result.</a>

        <a>I know, we are not talking about analytics and no, this is not going to set me as a great data scientist&hellip; By the way: have you ever wondered how to list all files and folders within a root folder just hitting a button?
I have been looking for something like that quite a lot of times, for instance when asked to write down an index of all the working papers pertaining to a specific audit ( yes, **I am an auditor, **sorry about that): really time-consuming and not really value-adding activity.</a>

        <a>Pushing to my Github repository directly from the Rstudio project, avoiding that annoying &ldquo;copy &amp; paste&rdquo; job. Since it is one of Best Practices for Scientific Computing, I have been struggling for a while with this problem. Now that I managed to solve the problem, I think you may find useful the detailed tutorial that follows. I am not going to explain you the reason why you should use Github with your Rstudio project, but if you are asking this to yourself, you may find useful a Stack Overflow discussion on the topic.</a>

        <a>Problem
If you have to put some math writing into your Evernote notes, and you have a Mac device, there is a very simple way to solve your problem out.
Solution
This way is called Grapher, a built-in application for visualising math stuffs.
Tutorial
Here below a simple tutorial:
1. find Grapher among your applications. You can either search for it within Spotlight or using the launchpad.

2. write the equation you would like to put into your Evernote note.</a>

      <span class="archive-item-date">

      </span><br>
        <a>Problem: you haveto subset a data frame using as criteria the exact match of a vector content.
for instance:
you have a dataset with some attributes, and you have a vector with some values of one of the attributes. You want to make a filter based on the values in the vector. Example: sales records, each record is a deal.
The vector is a list of selected customers you are interested in.</a>

        <a>I have just saturated all my PC:
full is the 4gb RAM

and so is the CPU (I7 4770 @3.4 GHZ)

Parallel Computation in R which is my secret?
the doParallel package for R on mac
The package lets you make some very useful parallel computation, giving you the possibility to use all the potentiality of your CPU.
As a matter of fact, the standard R option is to use just on of the cores you have got on your PC.</a>
