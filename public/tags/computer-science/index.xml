 changed my job ( I am now working @ Intesa Sanpaolo Banking Group on Basel III statistical models)
 became dad for the third time (and if you are guessing, it’s a boy!</description>

      <description>I reproduce here below principles from the amazing paper Best Practices for Scientific Computing, published on 2012 by a group of US and UK professors. The main purpose of the paper is to &amp;ldquo;teach&amp;rdquo; good programming habits shared from professional developers to people that weren&amp;rsquo;t born developer, and became developers just for professional purposes.
Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using software. However, most scientists are never taught how to do this efficiently Best Practices for Scientific Computing    Write programs for people, not computers.</description>
