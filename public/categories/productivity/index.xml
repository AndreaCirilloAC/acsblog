      <description>It has being nearly half an year since the last post about workflower was out, why did I stay so silent for that long?
I have three major updates to explain the silence:
 ðŸ“š Good guys atPackt publishing asked me to write one more book about R and data mining, I suppose this is because the first one was well received
 ðŸ“¦ I spend my spare time working on updateR so to get it ready to go on CRAN.</description>

      <description>I was crafting this checklist for my personal use, and then I found myself thinking: why should&amp;rsquo;nt I share this useful handful of bullets with my readers? So here we are, find below an useful checklist for your weekly review. The checklist is derived directly from the official GTD book by our great friend David Allen. The greatest quality of the checklist is the minimalist approach: just what you really need to read is written within each point, so that you get through your review as quick as possible.</description>

I have been looking for something like that quite a lot of times, for instance when asked to write down an index of all the working papers pertaining to a specific audit ( yes, **I am an auditor, **sorry about that): really time-consuming and not really value-adding activity.</description>
