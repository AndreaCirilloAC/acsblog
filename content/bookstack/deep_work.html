<h2>a really brief summary</h2>
<p>There are <strong>two diverging trends</strong> in our society:</p>
<ul>
<li>by one hand in our society tend to <strong>succeed</strong> those whose can be considered <strong>high-skilled</strong> like real professionals in data science realm</li>
<li>on the other hand the same society force ourself to an <strong>increasingly fragmented style of life</strong>, full of shallow stimolous and activites, like reading Facebook notifications or immediately reply to emails</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why the good author of the book calls for a <strong>regaining</strong> of the ability to perform <strong>Deep Work</strong> i.e. the kind of of activities performed in a state of <strong>distraction-free concentration</strong> that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. This efforts are the one able to <strong>create new value</strong>, improve your skill, and are <strong>hard to replicate</strong>.</p>
<p>Perfoming a lot of this work will make you rare and valuable, and hard to substitute.</p>
<p>To gain the ability to perform a relevant quantity of this kind of work, Cal defines and explains the <strong>following rules</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>work deeply</li>
<li>embrace boredom</li>
<li>quit social media</li>
<li>drain the shallows</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of this rules is explained an made applicable trough a set of practical advice and suggestions.</p>

<h2>what I have succesfully applied from this book</h2>
<p>After reading this book I <strong>dramatically changed my attitude trough work</strong>: rather than try to accomplish every kind of task I was charged of I started organizing my work day with <strong>a clear objective</strong>: devote the greatest number of hours to the <strong>activities which will make me valuable and possibly irreplaceable</strong>.</p>
<p>Moreover I started to fiercely <strong>defend the hours dedicated to those activities</strong>. This means becoming quite hard to be found in the morning, since it is for me the most productive time. To do so I set “do not disturb” as Skype status, I move all meetings in the afternoon and I do not open Outlook and Gmail before 11.00 (well sometimes I do it at 10.30, but you got the concept).</p>
<p>Tha main idea behind this is that something really urgent would arise before that hour it would find its own way to reach me, either trough phone call or in-person contact.</p>

<div id="has-it-worked" class="section level2">
<h2>has it worked?</h2>
<p><strong>It definitely worked</strong>, since after applying the advices included within the book and the main strategy described above, I managed to conclude the writing of my <a href="/pubblications/featured_book/">last book</a> and two more miliar activities at work, underlined from a public praise of my highest boss.</p>
