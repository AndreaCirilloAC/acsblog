I am currently reading this elegant book which definitely represents a milestone in the field of data visualisation.

So far, besides the iluminating principles and observation spreaded troughout the book, the feature I am appreciating the most is the ability to communicate how relevant data visualisation can be if practiced effectively, seriously and with integrity. 

That said... I am still reading the book, so stay tuned for a better summary to come!
