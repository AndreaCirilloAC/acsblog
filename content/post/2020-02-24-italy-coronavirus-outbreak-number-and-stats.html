<h2>Italy NCOV-19 outbreak</h2>
<p>For personal reasons I am trying to track the number of NCOV-19 confirmed cases in Italy as well as the number of deaths (since I live in Italy, it is not difficult to guess the personal reason…). I am thus regularly monitoring news from the italian official sources like “Regione Lombardia” and “Protezione Civile”.</p>
<p>You can find on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnhZe6_5m1wtLqDaTU-JzXrAHd0OKV7Uhrkh6G2BFn0/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet</a> the raw data I am collecting.</p>
<div id="number-of-confirmed-cases-and-deaths-in-italy" class="section level3">
<h3>number of confirmed cases and deaths in Italy</h3>
<p>Here is an attempt to visualize historical series of total confirmed cases and deaths</p>

<h3>daily change in confirmed cases in Italy</h3>
<p>and finally here a visualization of daily change in confirmed cases:</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare this trend with the one observed in Mainland China</p>

<p>The italian level is aligned with the one observed in China during the first part of the outbreak.</p>

<div id="daily-change-in-confirmed-cases-in-lombardy" class="section level3">
<h3>daily change in confirmed cases in Lombardy</h3>
<p>As you probably already know the most serious coronavirus outbreak started directly in Lombardy, where I currently live and I am writing from. I am therefore taking separared note of number related this region. You can find them on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnhZe6_5m1wtLqDaTU-JzXrAHd0OKV7Uhrkh6G2BFn0/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet</a> and the daily change plotted below:</p>

<div id="comparison-between-lombardy-and-hubei-province" class="section level3">
<h3>comparison between Lombardy and Hubei province</h3>
<p>Since Lombardy is the first place where coronavirus really appeared in Italy, and it currently is the region where the main outbreak is observed, I thought it would have been interesting to compare the shape of the cumulated number of confirmed cases measured in Lombardy with the same number measured in Hubei from the beginning of the outbreak.</p>

<p>We can see quite a similar pattern, even if at the moment it is not possible to predict which will be the final shape of the curve.</p>
