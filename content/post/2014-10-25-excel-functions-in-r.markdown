I have started my "data-journey" from Excel, getting excited by formulas like VLookup(), right() and left().







then datasets got bigger, and I discovered that little spreadsheets were not enough, and look for something bigger and stronger, eventually coming to R.







But as you know, **[ones never forget the first love](http://youtu.be/KAImMLplrPI)**.







So, for fun and for practice, I have written down some of excel functions in R.







I hope you will enjoy.
