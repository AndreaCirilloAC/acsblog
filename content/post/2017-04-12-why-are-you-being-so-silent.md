It has being nearly half an year since the last post about [workflower](https://andreacirilloblog.wordpress.com/2016/09/21/📊-streamline-your-analysis-linking-r-to-sas-and-more-the-workflower-experiment-🖥/) was out, why did I stay so silent for that long?

I have three **major updates** to explain the silence:



	
  * 📚 Good guys at[ Packt publishing](https://www.packtpub.com) asked me to write **one more boo**k about R and data mining, I suppose this is because [the first one](https://andreacirilloblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/over-50-practical-recipes-for-data-analysis-with-r-in-one-book/) was well received

	
  * 📦 I spend my spare time working on [updateR](https://andreacirilloblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/updater-package-update-r-version-with-a-function-on-mac-osx/) so to get it ready to go on CRAN. We make it so shining and bright that it got noticed by our beloved **Tal Galili** and we are now working togheter to [merge it into his great package installR](https://github.com/RobertMyles/installr).

	
  * 👶🏻 We at home are waiting the **fourth kid **


More is coming about the first two points later on this blog. If you are looking for more news on the third point you can write to me privately 🙂.
