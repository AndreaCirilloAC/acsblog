## celebrating beauty

PaletteR has been staying around for nearly two years, and #rstats users have made a lot of great stuff with it. I had therefore took the time to collect what I have found around the web, just to celebrate this beauty. You can find them below in a slideshow.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url('/slides/paletter_gallery_def.html')
```

<a href="http://www.andreacirillo.com/slides/paletter_gallery_def.html"> follow the link to view the gallery in full screen 


## add your own masterpiece

Adding what you have created with PaletteR is quite straightforward:

- go to the pubblic repository of my blog : https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/acsblog
- locate the rmarkdown code used to produce the slideshow: https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/acsblog/tree/master/static/slides
- create a pull request including a new chunk of code with your creation, following the scheme below.

Your chunk should have the following structure:

<img src="/images/code_chunk.png" width="100%">

The chunk should moreover be added at the end of the currend file, but before the final slide inviting people to use paletteR.

If you need more info about how to obtain a code to embeed your post please visit the official Twitter help page on the topic: https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-embed-a-tweet
