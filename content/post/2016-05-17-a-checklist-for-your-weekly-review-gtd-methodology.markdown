I was crafting this checklist for my personal use, and then I found myself thinking: why should'nt I share this useful handful of bullets with my readers? So here we are, find below an useful checklist for your weekly review. The checklist is derived directly from the [official GTD book](http://gettingthingsdone.com) by our great friend David Allen. The greatest quality of the checklist is the minimalist approach: just what you really need to read is written within each point, so that you get through your review as quick as possible. Enjoy!





## Weekly Review Checklist for GTD





 	
  * 


#### look for sleeping actions within SMS, mail, backpack, notes and whatever. collect everything into your inbox.




 	
  * 


#### look for previous and next weeks within your calendar, any sleeping action out there?




 	
  * 


#### process your just-feeded inbox, get it empty!




 	
  * 


#### check all actions you completed during past week and you didn't checked off because you were, as usual, in a rush




 	
  * 


#### look at your _waiting for_ list: any one to followup?




 	
  * 


#### look at your active projects: is there at least one _next action_ in the proper list for each one of them?




 	
  * 


#### look at your someday/maybe list: had come the time to embrace any parked project/action?





I personally use this checklist every Saturday morning and we can therefore give it for tested, nevertheless I am here to listen to every suggestion of improvement. You can download here below a PDF version of the checklist for your convenience.
