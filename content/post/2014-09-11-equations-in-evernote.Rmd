## Problem

Some time ago I was looking for an easy way to put some math writing within my Evernote notes trough my Mac device. Even if there is no official solution to the problem and the feature request is [still pending within Evernote dedicated forum](https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/111535-writing-math-symbols-and-equations/), I finally came out with a very simple way to solve your problem out.

## Solution

This way is called Grapher, a Mac OS built-in application for visualising math stuffs.

## Tutorial


Here below a simple tutorial:

### 1. find Grapher among your applications

You can either search for it within Spotlight or using the launchpad.

</figure></a>

### 2. write the equation

you would like to put into your Evernote note.

</figure></a>





### 3. copy the equation as [TIFF](http://http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format)

<a><figure class= "post_image" >

</figure></a>

### 4. paste the equation into Evernote

<a><figure class= "post_image" >
<img src="https://andreacirilloblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/3-equations-in-evernote.jpg"  alt="infoviz" style="width: 200px;"/>
</figure></a>

And thatâ€™s it!

I think this trick is very useful when you have some "heavy" equations that would not be clear enough if it would just be written in simple text.

### other ways to insert equations into evernote

#### Daum equation editor

Sharing the post on [Google + ](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndreaCirilloAC/posts/SGCWuFYcyDy?cfem=1)I have received the good advice to use [daum equation editor](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/daum-equation-editor/id540665783?mt=12), specifically aimed at writing equations.

I think the Grapher advantage is that is a built-in application, nevertheless I'm really grateful to [Roberta Normano ](https://plus.google.com/u/0/114794468455584031025/about)for the tip.

#### EATags

Eatags is another way to include equations into evernote. the mechanism here is to first write the equation into Latex and then include it into Evernote.
If you are thinking this is the right solution for you, you should hold on before searching "EATags" on Google, since the website is on maintenance.

Did you came out with any other way to address the problem?
