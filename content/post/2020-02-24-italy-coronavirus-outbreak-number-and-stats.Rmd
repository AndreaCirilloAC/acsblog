## Italy NCOV-19 outbreak

For personal reasons I am trying to track the number of NCOV-19 confirmed cases in Italy as well as the number of deaths. To do so I am regularly monitoring news from the italian official sources like "Regione Lombardia" and "Protezione Civile".

You can find on a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnhZe6_5m1wtLqDaTU-JzXrAHd0OKV7Uhrkh6G2BFn0/edit?usp=sharing)  the raw data I am collecting.

Here is an attempt to visualize historical series of total confirmed cases and deaths

and finally here a visualization of daily change in confirmed cases:

Let's pray for this numbers getting better and better each day.
