I really like to get in touch with people. Nevertheless I think getting in touch with people is something more profund that chatting on social media or exchanging emails.
That's why I use just Twitter among social media as feeding source and I do not actively interact with the great *web community*.
Plus, I do my best to strength my deep my expertise into statistical learning, data mining and data visualization, so to hopefully speed up my carrer and have something valuable to share back to the great community which helped me to get where I am (I do this mainly writing and giving speaches). 
Well, not to mention my four kids and the fact that I choosed not to have a smartphone, switching from a cutting edge Iphone to a far less shiny Nokia 150. 

All that premised you will easily understand that no much time is left to go trough my email inbox looking for relevant stuff.
That's why I do not have a general purposes email ( I actually use to have one but it got irredeemably full of spam) and I rather carefully crafted three main channels to get exposed to all relevant and promising opportunities.

### comments on packages/issues

I frequently blog about software I have developed. If you have any kind of comment, request of improvement and similar stuff, the best way to submit them is to reach the online github repository of the package and post there your request.
