I do not have a general purposes email ( I actually use to have one but it got irredeemably full of spam) but I carefully **crafted three main channels** to get exposed to all relevant and promising opportunities. 

You can find them below:

### Proposals of Blog Post/Speaches

author _at_ andreacirillo.com

### Collaboration proposals

you can use my linkedin profile to get in touch with me for proposals of every kind of collaboration, either requesting to connect or sending inmail messages:

### interesting stuff to read or watch

you can use one of my twitter profile to refer any interesting link or stuff, even considering that if it is interesting, why shouldn't we share it to everybody?

### comments on packages/issues

I frequently blog about software I have developed. If you have any kind of comment, request of improvement and similar stuff, the best way to submit them is to reach the online github repository of the package and post there your request.
