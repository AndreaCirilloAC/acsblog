**Benvenuto**, I am an Italian [**quantitative analyst**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cirilloandrea/) well versed into **statistical learning**, **data mining** and **data visualization** disciplines. 

I am the guy behind some beloved **#rstats packages** like [**updateR for Mac**](http://www.andreacirillo.com/2018/03/10/updater-package-update-r-version-with-a-function-on-mac-osx/), [**paletteR**](http://www.andreacirillo.com/2018/05/08/how-to-use-paletter-to-automagically-build-palettes-from-pictures/) and **Ramazon**. You can find more about my software within the [software page](/software). 

Within this website you can find:

-  Well crafted [**blog posts**](/post) mainly about analytics and R but also about miscellaneous stuff like productivity and work-life balance
-  My [**book stack**](/bookstack), I.e. book I have read and I recommend because they were relevant for my personal and professional development (and I guess it will be the same for you). 

If you have heard about my ***R data mining*** book you can find more info within the box below. 

Finally if you want to get in touch with me I suggest you to visit the [contacts](/contacts) page.
Cheers,
