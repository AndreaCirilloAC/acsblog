I am a **Quantitative Analyst** well versed into **statistical learning**, **data mining** and **data visualization** disciplines. I keep this personal website as a polished portfolio and a structured notebook. You can use this website to learn about my [curriculum vitae](/about), the [software](/software) I craft and my [personal thoughts](/post) about technical stuffs. 

I also keep an updated list of the most [relevant books](/bookstack) I have read, the ones I would suggest to a good friend, togheter with a short summary of their key messages. Just in case you don't know which book to pick up next from your bookstack.

If you want to get in touch with me I suggest you to visit the [contacts](/contacts) web page, since it is not exactly a straight forward process.

A final note: as I said you can take this as a notebook, expecting therefore to find in it masterpieces togheter with scraps.
