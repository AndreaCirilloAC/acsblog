<p><strong>R data mining</strong> is a <strong>data mining crime book</strong>, a new kind of book we developed with good guys at Packt and the great statistician Enrico Pegoraro.</p>

<p>What is a data mining crime book? It is a book stuctured to <strong>teach you data mining</strong> fundamentals <strong>while immersing</strong> you <strong>in a crime case</strong>.</p>
<p>Within R data mining you will be immersed into the life of a wholesale company, where suddenly a misterious drop in profits arises. You will be then caught into the analyses performed to discover where this drop comes from and why.</p>

<h3>what you will learn from it</h3>
<p>This will teach you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>take raw data and wrangle them</strong> so to make them <strong>tidy and ready</strong> for the analyses</li>
<li><strong>perform</strong> a wide range of <strong>descriptive analyses</strong> both graphically and not</li>
<li><strong>apply data mining algorithms</strong> to the data, from logistic regression to random forest and support vector machine.</li>
<li>perform <strong>text mining analyses</strong></li>
<li><strong>develop effective reports</strong> to highlight the main steps of analysis and its outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally you will <strong>discover the culpright</strong>, which obviously is…</p>

<h3>Why you should read it</h3>
<p>Beside the innovative approach one of the core features of the book is the care that was devoted to describe assumptions and rationales behind each algo. This was done because within <strong>the web</strong> there are <strong>tons of tutorials</strong> about data mining algorithms <strong>where models are just introduced</strong> and the simple R function is showed <strong>without</strong> taking the time to <strong>explain</strong> to the reader which is the main idea behind the model, <strong>when you should or should not use them</strong> in your analyses. This is actually a <strong>relevant point</strong> in data mining practice, especially if you want <strong>to avoid painful errors</strong>. <strong>Covering this point</strong> was thus defined as the <strong>mission of the book</strong> and represents the main reason why you could find it useful to read it.</p>
