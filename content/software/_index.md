# software

You can find below a recap of the most meaningful software I have developed so far. I am a lazy programmer (in the meaning adopted by [*the pragmatic programmer*](https://amzn.to/2HkfLRl)) and rather than copying and pasting a bunch of names and links from github I decided to generate the list dinamically from my [github profile](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC).
To do this I found a starting point in the good work by [George MacKerron](http://mackerron.com/home/). My version slightly modifies the original code to obtain only selected repositories. Find the original project on [George's repo](https://github.com/jawj/github-widget), and the modified one on mine blog repo, which by the way is listed below ;).

To read more documentaion about each project, and visualise the full code, just click on the project name and you will be redirected to the Github repo.

For some of those package you can also find detailed descriptions and tutorials within the [blog posts](/post).
