# software

You can find below a recap of the most meaningful software I have developedso far. Since I am a lazy developer I generate itdirectly from my github profile. To started from the good work of [George MacKerron](http://mackerron.com/home/) slightly modifying it to obtain only selected repositories. Find the original project on [George's repo](https://github.com/jawj/github-widget), and the modified one on mine blog repo, which by the way is listed below ;).

you can discover more about each repo and give a look to the full code simply navigating to the corresponding repo.
