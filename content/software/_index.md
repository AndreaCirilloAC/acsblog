# software

You can find below a recap of the most meaningful software I have developed so far. I am a lazy programmer (to know what I mean just have a look to [*the pragmatic programmer*](bookstack/pragmatic_programmer/) review in the [*bookstack*](/bookstack)) and rather than copying and pasting a bunch of names and links from github I decided to generate the listdirectly from my [github profile](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC).
I found a good starting point in the good work by [George MacKerron](http://mackerron.com/home/). This version slightly modifies the original code to obtain only selected repositories. Find the original project on [George's repo](https://github.com/jawj/github-widget), and the modified one on mine blog repo, which by the way is listed below ;).

To read more documentaion about each project, and visualise the full code, just click on the project name and you will be redirected to the Github repo.
